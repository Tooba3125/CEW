1.	Lockfile
Explanation:
`lockfile` is used to create semaphore files. These files can be used to ensure that only one instance of a script or command is running at a time.

Example:
lockfile myscript.lock
# Your critical section of code goes here rm myscript.lock
In this example, a lock file named `myscript.lock` is created before entering the critical section. After the critical section is done, the lock file is removed.

2.	cksum
Explanation:
`cksum` is used to display the CRC (cyclic redundancy check) checksum and the byte count of a file.

Example:
cksum myfile.txt
This command will output the CRC checksum, the number of bytes in the file, and the file name.



3.	comm
Explanation:
`comm` is used to compare two sorted files line by line.

Example:
comm file1.txt file2.txt
This command will display three columns: lines unique to file1, lines unique to file2, and lines common to both files.
 
4.	csplit
Explanation:
`csplit` is used to split a file into sections determined by context lines.

Example:
csplit myfile.txt '/pattern/' '{*}'
This command splits `myfile.txt` into multiple files at lines containing the specified pattern.

5.	chattr
Explanation:
`chattr` is used to change file attributes on a Linux file system.

Example:
chattr +i myfile.txt```
This command sets the "immutable" attribute on `myfile.txt`, preventing it from being modified, deleted, or renamed.


6.	touch
Explanation:
`touch` is used to create an empty file or update the access and modification times of an existing file.

Examples:
->touch newfile.txt
This creates a new empty file named `newfile.txt`.
->touch existingfile.txt
This updates the access and modification times of `existingfile.txt` to the current time
